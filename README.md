## Challenges

List some of the challenges you faced during the project development:

#### Challenge 1: Dynamic Data Presentation by Categories
A core challenge revolved around dynamically presenting data categorized by distinct facets. We seamlessly integrated React Router to establish dedicated routes for each category, enabling tailored API calls for precise data rendering.

**Approach**: Leveraging React Router, we constructed purpose-specific routes, efficiently isolating data display for each category. Ternary operators were employed to conditionally render data based on user selection or all-encompassing displays.

**Outcome**: Our strategic implementation of dynamic routing and API integration led to fluid category-based data presentation. This highlighted our adept data rendering skills and commitment to an intuitive user experience.
